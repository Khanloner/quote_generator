I got to the point where I couldn\'t make friends, and I started hating myself more and more. I became completely unable to smile. I thought, no one in the world would ever like me the way I am now. But at the same time I also thought, if that\'s the way it is, then I should at least like myself.'

People will never attain the hope that is to be found from casting their fears aside and preserving through them. While it is true that people can continue to press forward through the simple act of living... That is no way comparable to marching forward in the face of death, while doing their damndest to keep it at bay. That is why... That is why people have given that very march a unique and special name. "COURAGE."'
